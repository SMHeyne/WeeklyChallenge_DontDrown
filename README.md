Weekly Game Challenge - Week 28: Don't Drown

An orthographic runner in which the player plays as a soul, that can take over tools to find a path through the forest, to not drown.
Couldn't finish all planned features due to not being able to fix a bug within the one week.

Main goal: experiment with the perspective, make the player character change and remove objects from way only with matching tool + Bonus: works with keyboard and controller!
